<h2><em>Funnel Cake Ingredients</em></h2>

<ul>
    <li>· Oil: You'll need about a quart of vegetable oil for frying the funnel cakes.</li>
    <li>· Milk: Milk lends moisture, ensuring a perfectly tender funnel cake.</li>
    <li>. Eggs: Two eggs lend even more moisture. Plus, they act as a binder for the batter.</li>
    <li>· Flour: All-purpose flour creates structure in the funnel cake batter.</li>
    <li>· Baking powder: Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it helps the batter rise.</li>
    <li>· Cinnamon and salt: Ground cinnamon and a pinch of salt enhance the overall flavor of the funnel cakes.</li>
    <li>· Sugar: Sprinkle the funnel cakes with powdered sugar (a.k.a. confectioners' sugar) right before serving.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Make a Funnel Cake</h2>

<p>Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade funnel cakes</p>

<p>1. Make the batter.</p>
<p>2. Funnel the batter into the hot oil using circular motions.</p>
<p>3. Sprinkle the funnel cakes with powdered sugar before serving.</p>
    <h3>How to Store Funnel Cake</h3>
    <P>Funnel cakes are best served fresh. However, if you have leftovers, you can store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to three days. Reheat them in the oven instead of the microwave to crisp them back up.</P>
 <h3>Ingredients</h3>

 <ul>
<li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
<li>1 ½ cups milk</li>
<li>2 large eggs</li>
<li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
<li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
<li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
<li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
<li>¾ cup confectioners' sugar</li>

<h3>step 1</h3>
<p>Heat oil to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) in a heavy skillet.</p>

<h3>step 2</h3>
<p>Beat milk and eggs together in a large bowl. Combine flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt in a separate bowl; stir into egg mixture until smooth.</p>

<h3>step 3</h3>
<p>Use your finger to cover the funnel hole; pour in 1 cup of batter. Starting in the center of the skillet, remove your finger and move the funnel in a swirling motion to make a 6- or 7-inch round. Fry in hot oil until bottom is golden brown; flip and continue cooking until golden brown all over, about 1 minute per side. Drain on paper towels. Continue cooking remaining batter.</p>
