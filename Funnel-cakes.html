<h2><em>Funnel Cake Ingredients</em></h2>

<ul>
    <li>· Oil: You'll need about a quart of vegetable oil for frying the funnel cakes.</li>
    <li>· Milk: Milk lends moisture, ensuring a perfectly tender funnel cake.</li>
    <li>. Eggs: Two eggs lend even more moisture. Plus, they act as a binder for the batter.</li>
    <li>· Flour: All-purpose flour creates structure in the funnel cake batter.</li>
    <li>· Baking powder: Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it helps the batter rise.</li>
    <li>· Cinnamon and salt: Ground cinnamon and a pinch of salt enhance the overall flavor of the funnel cakes.</li>
    <li>· Sugar: Sprinkle the funnel cakes with powdered sugar (a.k.a. confectioners' sugar) right before serving.</li>
</ul>
